    "description": "Arduino library for the STMicroelectronics LIS2DH12 accelerometer. The LIS2DH12 is an ultra-low-power high-performance three-axis linear accelerometer belonging to the femto family with digital I2C\/SPI serial interface standard output. The LIS2DH12 has user-selectable full scales of \u00b12g\/\u00b14g\/\u00b18g\/\u00b116g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to 5.3 kHz. The device may be configured to generate interrupt signals by detecting two independent inertial wake-up\/free-fall events as well as by the position of the device itself.",
